# Flutter Beta Changelog Summary

This app provides a concise weekly summary of the latest changes in the Flutter `beta` channel. Instead of sifting through numerous commits, it organizes updates by week and tags them into categories like **New**, **Improved**, **Fixed**, **Changed**, and **Removed**, making it easy to stay informed.

## Features
- **Weekly Summaries:** Changes are grouped by week for quick scanning.
- **Categorized Updates:** Clear sections highlight new features, improvements, fixes, and more.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, Material 3-inspired interface with `flex_color_scheme` ensures a pleasant reading experience.
- **Real-Time Data:** Always fetches the latest updates from `flutter/flutter` `beta`.
